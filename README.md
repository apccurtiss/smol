Smol
====

A static site generater that doesn't have _opinions_. No magic directories or special variables. It's still under construction, so check back later.

A fork of [![makesite][SOURCE-BADGE]](https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite) although by now it's virtually unrecognizable.

Introduction
------------

Smol is a static site generator written in Python. It has as few opinions as possible.


But Why?
--------

Jekyll, Hugo, et al introduce excess complexity into what should be a simple process. Smol does away with magic variables and opinionated filesystem requirements, letting you build your site however you like.
